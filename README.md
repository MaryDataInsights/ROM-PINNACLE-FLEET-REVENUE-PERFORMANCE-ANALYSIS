RECOMMENDATIONS
Since classic cars are the highest revenue-generating product—especially in cities like San Rafael, Madrid, and New York—SmartTech should focus on expanding inventory, offering promotions, and allocating more marketing budget to this category to further boost performance.

With November consistently driving peak sales across all product types and countries, the company should launch targeted seasonal campaigns, special offers, or pre-holiday promotions during this month to maximize revenue potential.

As 80% of customers prefer products priced between $0–$5,000, They should consider developing and promoting more entry-level products in this range. This aligns with customer affordability preferences and can drive higher unit sales.

With the USA contributing the highest total revenue ($3.6M) and cities like San Rafael and New York being top performers, they should consider scaling operations, expanding distribution networks, or opening new outlets in these high-potential regions.

Although Australia generated less revenue overall, its strong performance in November and high sales in Melbourne suggest a growing market. SmartTech should explore targeted advertising, region-specific deals, and localized inventory planning to boost performance

Only 1% of total sales came from the $10,000–$15,000 price range. To improve this, they should enhance the perceived value of premium products with better features, bundled offers, or financing options to make them more attractive.

Products like trucks and buses have lower sales and seasonally variable performance. Stakeholders should investigate reasons behind July’s sales dip, reassess demand, and possibly diversify or reposition these products.

Cities like Madrid and San Rafael, which consistently lead in revenue across various product categories, should be analyzed further to understand consumer preferences, sales tactics, and local market conditions that can be replicated elsewhere.

CONCLUSION
This analysis highlights key sales trends, top-performing products, and high-revenue locations, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Classic cars emerged as the best-selling product, with a significant revenue peak in November, indicating a potential seasonal or strategic factor worth replicating. Lower-priced products ($0–$5,000) dominated sales, suggesting a need for targeted promotions on higher-priced items. The USA and Madrid led in revenue generation, reinforcing the importance of these markets. Australia's sales trends indicate an opportunity to apply successful strategies from November to boost performance throughout the year. To maximize revenue, stakeholders should focus on scaling effective sales strategies, optimizing inventory for high-demand products, and implementing targeted promotions for underperforming categories.
